# Climate-action-UX-UI
Climate action desktop UX/UI 2020

This repository contains the UX/UI work for a climate action project. No code is included in this repository.

## Description

The goal of this project was to design and prototype the user interface (desktop) and user experience for a climate action website. It includes mockups and design assets.

I was part of a design team consisting of three people. I contributed to producing all major deliverables and presented these with my teammates to the client.
- Style tiles/ moodboards by me.
